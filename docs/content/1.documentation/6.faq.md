## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting an error about missing permissions

::alert{type="warning"}
Ensure you are running the Ansible playbook with the `-K` flag. It will ask you for root user password which is necessary for executing tasks that require elevated privileges, such as modifying system settings or installing packages.

### The installation is taking a very long time

::p
The installation time can vary depending on your internet connection speed and the number of packages being installed. If it seems excessively long, check your network connectivity and ensure no other processes are heavily utilizing your system resources.
