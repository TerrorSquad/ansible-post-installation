# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

### What package manager is used?

::list

- This playbook primarily uses `apt` for installing packages on Debian-based systems.
- It also utilizes `brew` (Homebrew) for installing additional packages not available in the default repositories.
::

### Installation fails on a `homebrew` task

::list

- If the installation fails on a `homebrew` task, it is most likely due to a network issue.
- Check your internet connection and try running the playbook again.
::

### I'm getting GitHub API rate limit errors

::alert{type="info"}
Griffin downloads many packages from GitHub releases. The rate limit for unauthenticated requests is 60 per hour.
::

**Solutions:**
::list
- **Use a GitHub token**: Generate a personal access token and use `-e github_token=YOUR_TOKEN`
- **Wait and retry**: Rate limits reset every hour
- **Install fewer packages**: Use specific feature flags instead of `-e all=true`

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting an error about missing permissions

::alert{type="warning"}
Ensure you are running the Ansible playbook with the `-K` flag. It will ask you for root user password which is necessary for executing tasks that require elevated privileges, such as modifying system settings or installing packages.
::

### The installation is taking a very long time

::p
The installation time can vary depending on your internet connection speed and the number of packages being installed. If it seems excessively long, check your network connectivity and ensure no other processes are heavily utilizing your system resources.
::

### Can I customize the list of installed software?

::p
Absolutely! Griffin is designed to be flexible. You can edit the Ansible playbooks (`.yaml` files) to add, remove, or modify the list of installed software to suit your specific needs.
::

### How do I update the installed software?

::p
You can rerun the Ansible playbook to update the installed software to their latest versions. The idempotent nature of Ansible ensures that only necessary updates will be performed.
::

### I'm encountering an error I can't resolve. Where can I get help?

::p
If you're facing an issue you can't troubleshoot, you can:
::

::list

- Create an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
::

### Does Griffin work on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)?

::alert{type="info"}
Yes! Griffin fully supports WSL. The playbook automatically detects WSL environments and adjusts accordingly.
::

**WSL-specific behavior:**
::list
- **Visual Studio Code**: Skipped on WSL (use Windows version with Remote-WSL extension)
- **Power management (tlp)**: Skipped (not applicable in WSL)
- **GUI applications**: Install normally, but require X server on Windows to display
- **Systemd services**: May have limited functionality depending on WSL version
::

**Recommendation:**
::list
- Use WSL 2 for better compatibility
- Install Windows Terminal for improved terminal experience
- Use VSCode with Remote-WSL extension for seamless development
::
