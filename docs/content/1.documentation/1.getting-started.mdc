# Introduction

## Overview

With **Griffin**, you can transform a newly installed Debian-based Linux system into a fully-configured, efficient, and consistent environment with just one command. This project eliminates the need for manual configuration and repetitive post-installation steps, offering a streamlined approach to setting up a well-configured Linux system.

## Purpose

Post-installation tasks can be tedious and time-consuming, particularly when managing multiple systems. By automating these tasks with Ansible playbooks, you can ensure consistency and save valuable time. **Griffin** provides a curated set of tasks and configurations that would otherwise require hours of manual setup. This project is designed to assist system administrators and developers in quickly setting up new systems or maintaining existing ones with minimal effort.
