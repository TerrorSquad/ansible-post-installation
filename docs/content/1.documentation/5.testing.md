# Testing

## GitHub Actions

Griffin is automatically tested on every push using GitHub Actions across three platforms:

- **Ubuntu 24.04** - Full installation with all flags enabled
- **macOS (latest)** - Full installation including GUI apps
- **WSL** - CLI-only installation (no GUI)

Workflow files are located in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ubuntu.yaml` - Ubuntu testing
- `macos.yaml` - macOS testing
- `wsl.yaml` - WSL testing

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the testing process, consult the [FAQ](faq) for assistance.
