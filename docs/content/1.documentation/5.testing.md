# Testing

## GitHub Actions

Griffin is automatically tested on every push using GitHub Actions across three platforms:

- **Ubuntu 24.04** - Full installation with all flags enabled
- **macOS (latest)** - Full installation including GUI apps
- **WSL** - CLI-only installation (no GUI)

Workflow files are located in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ubuntu.yaml` - Ubuntu testing
- `macos.yaml` - macOS testing
- `wsl.yaml` - WSL testing

## Testing with Vagrant

To test the Ansible playbook locally, you can leverage Vagrant to create a virtualized environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Vagrant:** A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments
- **VirtualBox:** A virtualization platform that Vagrant uses

Install on Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt install -y vagrant virtualbox
```

### Testing Steps

Follow these steps to set up and test your Ansible playbook with Vagrant:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
::alert
Ensure you are in the root directory of your Griffin project where the `Vagrantfile` and `playbook_vagrant.yaml` files are located.
::
2. **Create and Provision the Vagrant Box:**
   Run the following command to create a new Vagrant box and provision it with your Ansible playbook:

   ```bash
   vagrant up --provision
   ```

   This will:
   - Download the specified Ubuntu image (if not already present)
   - Create a virtual machine based on that image
   - Execute the `playbook_vagrant.yaml` Ansible playbook to configure the virtual machine

3. **Force Destroy and Recreate (Optional):**

   If you need to start from a clean slate or make changes to your Ansible playbook, you can force destroy the existing box and recreate it:

   ```bash
   vagrant destroy --force && vagrant up --provision
   ```

### Important Notes

::alert{type="info"}
The Vagrantfile in your project is already configured to use `playbook_vagrant.yaml` as the Ansible entry point.
::

::alert
Base Box: The Vagrant setup uses the `ubuntu/mantic64` box. You can find more information about this box on [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/session).
