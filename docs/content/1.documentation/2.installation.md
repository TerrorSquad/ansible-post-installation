## Behind a Proxy?

If you're behind a proxy like Zscaler, there's an additional step:

Add the Zscaler root certificate:

You'll need to add the Zscaler root certificate to your system's trust store. This is typically located at `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/`.

We've included a helper script to simplify this process.

Always review any script before running it to ensure it's safe.
