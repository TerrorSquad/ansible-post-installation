# Testing - Vagrant

To the the playbook locally we can use Vagrant.

There are `Vagrantfile` and a `playbook_vagrant.yml` files. These two are set up for working with Vagrant and testing the configuration.

- Install Vagrant

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y vagrant virtualbox
  ```

- Create a Vagrant box and provision it

  ```bash
  vagrant up --provision
  ```

- Force destroy and recreate the box

  ```bash
  vagrant destroy --force && vagrant up --provision
  ```

> Vagrantfile will use `playbook_vagrant.yml` file as the `Ansible` entrypoint.
> Box name `ubuntu/mantic64` - <https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/mantic64>
