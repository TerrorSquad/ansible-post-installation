# FAQ

## What package manager is used?

- This playbook uses `apt` package manager for installing packages on Debian-based systems.
- It also uses `brew` for installing other packages not available in the default repositories.

## Installation fails on a `homebrew` task

- If the installation fails on a `homebrew` task, it is most likely due to a network issue.
- Check your internet connection and try running the playbook again.
