## GitHub Actions

Griffin is automatically tested on every push using GitHub Actions across three platforms:

- **Ubuntu 24.04** - Full installation with all flags enabled
- **macOS (latest)** - Full installation including GUI apps
- **WSL** - CLI-only installation (no GUI)

Workflow files are located in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ubuntu.yaml` - Ubuntu testing
- `macos.yaml` - macOS testing
- `wsl.yaml` - WSL testing

## Local Testing

### Molecule

We use [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) for local testing of the Ansible role. This allows you to verify changes in an isolated Docker container before pushing code.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker
- Python 3
- Molecule (`pip install molecule molecule-plugins[docker]`)

**Running Tests:**
To run the full test suite (create, converge, verify, destroy):
```bash [Terminal]
cd post-installation
molecule test
```

To just run the playbook (useful for iterating):
```bash [Terminal]
molecule converge
```

### Linting

We use `ansible-lint` to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

**Running Linter:**
```bash [Terminal]
ansible-lint
```

This check is also enforced in CI via the `lint.yaml` workflow.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the testing process, consult the [FAQ](faq) for assistance.
